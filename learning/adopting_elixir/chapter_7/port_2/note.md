Unlike in [port_1](https://github.com/Mdlkxzmcp/various_elixir/tree/master/learning/adopting_elixir/chapter_7/port_1), the `IO.stream/2` function in `all_caps.exs` reads only the first four bytes. It then decodes those bytes into an integer representing the length of the message. After that it writes the message back with the computed length of the message as the first 32 bits and the message itself as the rest. The returned message might be of different length due to the way ASCII characters are represented.
