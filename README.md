###  Identicon
A small project that for the most part gives me a place to include some new techniques (like how to set up and do property based testing). Also just a nice thingy that creates images based on input.

---
### learning
Folder containing various code I've (re)written and that I understand (but mostly did not come up with). Some of which containes information about the source and such.
#### Budget:
Tbh I don't know, might've been a part of a Elixir meetup I attended in early 2017
#### Cards:
Same here...
#### Cart:
This one is 100% from the said meetup.
#### [ElixirSips](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elixir):
Barely even started... Will probably update this once I do some more stuff :>
#### Example_Elmchemy:
From when [Elchemy](https://github.com/wende/elchemy) was still called `Elmchemy`. A follow along to the first blog posts about using it.
#### [Gnome](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers):
A fantastic course from Dave Thomas, highly recommended.
#### Meetup_2018_03/Streams:
A simple stream lib that I wrote as a part of the Elixir Meetup @ErlangSoutions.
#### [Metaprogramming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir):
A wonderful tour of the metaprogramming powers that come with Elixir.
#### [Omgneering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp01DFl8kp-239gW289C0ew):
Code from the Youtube series made by [@Omgneering](https://github.com/omgneering). Worth the watch.
#### [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3):
Notes and such from the 1.3 book. It is a bit outdated now, and I can't wait for the updated version.
#### [RedFour](https://bigmachine.io/products/take-off-with-elixir):
A fantastic book/video-set on using Elixir. Unlike most other sources, this one implements one big project instead of many smaller ones.
#### Wwfcheater:
Same as the first 3. 2017 meetup that got me hooked on Elixir.
